# VK Data Sketch Plugin

## Installation

The plugin comes bundled with Sketch 52, but if for some reason you’ve lost it, you can [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/VKCOM/vkdata-sketchplugin/releases).

## Features

Get Avatars, names and video thumbnails from your account at vk.com, using Sketch 52’s new Data Supplier feature.

You can use it from the toolbar Data icon…
